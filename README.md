# Salary Calculator GUI using Python & PyQt5

This is a side project I created when I was learning GUI and specially PyQt5.

## Side Project explained: 
### Inputs:
`Monthly Salary`: The fixed salary every month.

`Monthly Charges`: The estimated expenses every month.

`Bonus Months Number`: The number of months you get extra bonus,  If you have no bonus just leave it at 0. If you put 0 here the next field will be deactivated automatically.

`Bonus Value`: Your total salary in the bonus months, eg. your fixed salary is $1000 and in the 3 months of the year you got the bonus which is $300 extra so you will put in this files the total salary in those months, in this case, will be $1300. 

`Currency`: it just a fancy way to display the currency symbol, so it's not a converter between currencies (I know it's a stupid dropdown menu, but it's OK).

`Years to calculate`: Number of years you want to calculate, to get how much money you spend and how much money you earn and the net profit between charges and salary.

### Outputs:

`Annual`: Displays the time when you will have all those numbers below.

The rest of Filed I think It's self-explanatory.

## Dependencies
Python version I used 3.8.5.

Install PyQt5 using:

```
pip install PyQt5
```
